Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and dataset from kaggle used in this project is used to predict mortality by heart failure. People who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management, this is where a machine learning model comes into play.

This project has analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. In this assignment different models were trained and predictions are made with different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB, support Vector Machine and Artificial neural network etc. This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset os used from kaggle.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
